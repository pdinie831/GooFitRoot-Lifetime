This example is to run a fit based on convolved PDFs. The test sample under the dataFiles directory contains reconstructed mass information and is from MC simulation.
You need to make the current project with 

$ gmake zach

to get the executable file "zach". In the file "Makefile", please make sure that the environment variable CUDALOCATION points to your CUDA install and GOOFITDIR points to the base GooFit directory.
Also make sure that the directory ${GooFitPATH}/rootstuff is included in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so that the library libRootUtils.so can be properly loaded before running any fit.

For the executable "zach", it usually takes one number 0, 1, or 2 as its command-line argument. The speedup performance is somewhat of an disappointment for the moment compared to the pipipi0DPFit example.
